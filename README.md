# Objective
We want to build on and improve the CoalFace NZ website. 

Currently it is a static website built on Wix. However some components are dated or broken.

## Original Design
Notice that the header is badly centered and contains elements that appear dated and unprofessional. Multiple pages (some non-functioning) can be accessed through the nav-bar

<br>
The Logo and Branding will undergo redsign also. However, this will be treated as exogenous to this repository. It will inform our desicions and colour palletes, but this repository will likely not concern itself with the specifics of the logo.
<br><br>
The contact us option is interesting. I believe it uses PHP. This will likely require more investigation.
